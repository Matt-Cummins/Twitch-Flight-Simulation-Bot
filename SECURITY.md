Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing xbard@protonmail.com. Please provide detailed information about the issue, including steps to reproduce the vulnerability.

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously and will respond as quickly as possible to determine the impact and appropriate course of action.

Security Best Practices

Environment Variables: Ensure all sensitive data, such as API keys and MongoDB URIs, are stored in environment variables and not committed to the codebase.

Access Control: Limit access to configuration files and sensitive information. Only authorized personnel should have the necessary permissions.

Dependency Management: Keep all dependencies up to date, especially those related to security, to minimize vulnerabilities.

Rate Limiting: The bot uses rate limiting (ratelimit) to prevent abuse of Twitch services and protect against spam attacks.

Incident Response

In the event of a security incident, our response will include the following steps:

Identification: Confirm the existence of the issue.

Containment: Prevent further exploitation of the vulnerability.

Eradication: Fix the root cause of the vulnerability.

Recovery: Restore normal operations.

Follow-up: Analyze the incident and improve security measures to prevent future vulnerabilities.
